The sr_cyberglove_remapper node maps raw sensor readings from the Cyberglove to joint angles of
the Shadow Hand via a linear regression calibration developed at UHAM, the corresponding calibration
files are /param/abg.txt and param/gains.txt. The two wrist joints follow a hardcoded linear
mapping. Start the node with roslaunch sr_cyberglove_remapper sr_cyberglove_remapper_mpv.launch. This will publish on the mixed position velocity controller topics. sr_cyberglove_remapper sr_cyberglove_remapper_ic.launch publishes on the impedance control topics whereas sr_cyberglove_remapper sr_cyberglove_remapper_sud.launch outputs on the sendupdate topic.


The project_eigenspace service allows to project the joint_angles onto a subspace of a specified
eigenspace (also contained in the /param folder). A valid eigenspace matrix has to have dimensions
18x18 (corresponding to the number of actuated joints of the CR5 Shadow Hand) and correspond to the
following joint-ordering:

THJ1
THJ2
THJ3
THJ4
THJ5
FFJ0
FFJ3
FFJ4
MFJ0
MFJ3
MFJ4
RFJ0
RFJ3
RFJ4
LFJ0
LFJ3
LFJ4
LFJ5

From a terminal, the service can be called via e.g. rosservice call
/sr_cyberglove_remapper/project_eigenspace '{type: Writing_Tripod, dim: 12}'

type: has to be one of: Global, Tripod, Palmar_Pinch, Lateral, Writing_Tripod, Parallel_Extension,
Adduction_Grip, Tip_Pinch or Lateral_Tripod.  

dim: the first 'dim' principle components used for the projection - has to be between 1 and 18
